Trucker is a gem for migrating legacy data into a Rails app.

1. Install the trucker gem and add to your gem config block.

2. Generate the basic trucker files

    script/generate truck

    * Add legacy adapter to database.yml
    * Add legacy base class
    * (Optionally) Add legacy sub classes for all existing models
    * Add app/models/legacy to load path in Rails Initializer config block
    * Generate sample migration task (using pluralized model names)
  
3. Update database.yml with legacy database info

4. Run rake db:create:all to create the legacy database

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
